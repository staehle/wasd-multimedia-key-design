# Staehle's Multimedia Keycaps as SVG for WASD Custom Printing

Custom order for various fill-ins for keycap sets that are missing certain media keys or are missing certain navigation keys in certain row profiles:
 * Play/Pause
 * Next Track
 * Previous Track
 * Volume Up
 * Volume Down
 * Mute
 * Insert
 * Home
 * Page Up
 * Delete
 * End
 * Page Down

Also since this was for a [WASD 104-key order](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/104-key-custom-cherry-mx-keycap-set.html), various 1.5+u blanks and Linux / Tux and Windows 95 / 98 1.25u OS modifier keys. (Love the old-school Win-key aesthetic.)
